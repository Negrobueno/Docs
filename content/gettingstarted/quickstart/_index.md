## Setup SDK

Download and install the Zapic SDK for your game.

[Unity]({{< ref "sdk/unity" >}}) - Build/export to iOS and Android

[Native iOS]({{< ref "sdk/ios" >}}) - Any Objective-C or Swift game engine such as SpriteKit or Cocos2d.

[Native Android]({{< ref "sdk/android" >}}) - Any Java or Kotlin engine.

## Add Zapic Button

As a developer, you are required to include a Zapic button prominently on your game’s main menu. This lets your players know that Zapic is enabled and gives players a way to access the features of Zapic.

This button may be skinned to match other menu items, but it should clearly show the Zapic “Z” logo in accordance with the [brand guidelines](https://www.zapic.com/brand).
